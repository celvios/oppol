## Quarter 1 (Months 1-3): Foundation & Utility

### **Phase 1A: Enhanced Token Gating** ✅ (Partially Complete)
*Build upon existing BC400 market creation gating*

- [x] BC400 or NFT required for market creation (DONE)
- [ ] **Tiered creation limits** based on BC400 holdings
  - 10M BC400: 5 markets
  - 50M BC400: 15 markets
  - 100M BC400: 50 markets
- [ ] **Staked BC400 benefits** - Lock tokens for enhanced limits
- [ ] **Market boost fees** - Pay BC400 to feature markets on homepage

### **Phase 1B: Trading Fee Discounts**
*Reward BC400 holders with reduced trading costs*

**Implementation:**
```solidity
function calculateFeeDiscount(address user) returns (uint256) {
    uint256 balance = BC400.balanceOf(user);
    
    if (balance >= 100_000_000 * 1e9) return 50; // 50% discount
    if (balance >= 50_000_000 * 1e9) return 30;  // 30% discount
    if (balance >= 10_000_000 * 1e9) return 15;  // 15% discount
    return 0; // No discount
}

// Apply in buyShares:
uint256 baseFee = (cost * protocolFee) / 10000;
uint256 discount = calculateFeeDiscount(msg.sender);
uint256 finalFee = baseFee - (baseFee * discount / 100);
```

**Impact:**
- High-volume traders incentivized to hold BC400
- Creates natural buy pressure
- Reduces sell pressure (holding > selling)

### **Phase 1C: Creator Revenue Sharing**
*Market creators earn BC400 rewards*

- Markets earning >$1K volume: Creator gets 100K BC400 bonus
- Markets earning >$10K volume: 1M BC400 bonus
- Top 10 weekly markets: Split 10M BC400 reward pool
- **Paid from treasury or minted** (decide deflationary vs inflationary)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Incentivizes quality market creation
- Drives user acquisition (creators recruit traders)
- Increases platform engagement

## Quarter 2 (Months 4-6): Staking & Rewards

### **Phase 2A: BC400 Staking Pools**
*Lock tokens, earn rewards + platform benefits*

**Three Staking Tiers:**

| Tier | Stake Amount | Lock Period | APY | Benefits |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| Bronze | 10M BC400 | 30 days | 8% | 10% fee discount, 2 boosted markets/month |
| Silver | 50M BC400 | 90 days | 15% | 25% fee discount, 5 boosted markets/month, early access |
| Gold | 100M BC400 | 180 days | 25% | 50% fee discount, unlimited boosts, governance votes |

**Reward Sources:**
1. 10% of protocol fees → staking pool (in USDC)
2. BC400 emissions (controlled inflation)
3. 20% of creator fees → redistributed to stakers

### **Phase 2B: Liquidity Mining for Markets**
*Provide liquidity to markets, earn BC400*

**How it works:**
- Users can deposit USDC into market liquidity pools
- Automated market maker uses their capital for trades
- Earn:
  - Trading fees (USDC)
  - BC400 rewards (proportional to liquidity provided)
  - Bonus multiplier for long-term LPs

**Example:**
```
User deposits $1,000 USDC to "Presidential Election" market
- Earns 0.2% of all trades using their liquidity
- Earns 500 BC400/day for 30 days
- 1.5x multiplier if kept for 90+ days
```

### **Phase 2C: Trading Volume Rewards**
*Active traders earn BC400 cashback*

- Top 100 weekly traders by volume: Split 50M BC400 pool
- Daily trading milestones:
  - $100 volume: 10K BC400
  - $500 volume: 75K BC400
  - $1,000 volume: 200K BC400
- **Reduces net trading cost**, encourages higher volume

---

## Quarter 3 (Months 7-9): Governance & Gamification

### **Phase 3A: Decentralized Governance**
*BC400 holders control platform decisions*

**Voting Power:**
- 1 BC400 = 1 vote
- Staked BC400 = 2x voting power
- Long-term stakers (180+ days) = 3x voting power

**Governance Decisions:**
1. **Market resolution disputes** - Community votes on controversial outcomes
2. **Protocol fee changes** - Adjust fee % (within bounds)
3. **Feature prioritization** - What to build next
4. **Treasury allocation** - Marketing, partnerships, buybacks
5. **Market category additions** - Sports, crypto, politics, etc.

**Implementation:**
- Snapshot-style voting (gas-free)
- 3-day voting period
- 10M BC400 minimum to create proposals

  - 100 referrals: 50M BC400 + revenue share deal

---

## Quarter 4 (Months 10-12): Advanced Features & Sustainability

### **Phase 4A: BC400 as Collateral**
*Use BC400 to trade without depositing USDC*

**Overcollateralized Lending:**
```
User locks 100M BC400 ($1,000 value)
Platform lends 500 USDC (50% LTV)
User trades with borrowed USDC
Uses winnings to repay or auto-settles from BC400
```

**Benefits:**
- Locks BC400 out of circulation (deflationary)
- Enables trading without selling BC400
- New utility = price support

### **Phase 4B: Deflationary Mechanisms**
*Reduce BC400 supply over time*

**Token Burns:**
1. **Trading Fee Burns** - 25% of protocol fees used to buy + burn BC400
2. **Market Resolution Burns** - 1% of losing side's bets → BC400 buyback + burn
3. **Penalty Burns** - Slashed staking penalties = burned
4. **Feature Burns** - Pay BC400 to boost markets → 50% burned

**Example Math:**
```
Platform doing $1M/month volume
10% fees = $100K revenue
25% for burns = $25K/month BC400 buyback
At $0.01/BC400 = 2.5B BC400 burned monthly
Over 12 months = 30B BC400 removed from circulation
```

### **Phase 4C: Premium Features (BC400 Exclusive)**

- Example: "Hold $100 worth of BC400" instead of "Hold 10M BC400"

### **Regulatory Compliance**
- **Solution:** Geo-fence restricted countries, KYC for high-value users
- Consult legal before governance/staking

### **Smart Contract Risks**
- **Solution:** Audit all token integration contracts
- Bug bounty program
- Insurance fund (3% of fees)

### **Low Adoption**
- **Solution:** Aggressive incentives early (higher rewards)
- Marketing blitz coordinated with feature launches
- Partner with BC400 communities
